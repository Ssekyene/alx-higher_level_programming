|0-rectangle.py			|an empty class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle	|
|1-rectangle.py			|a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with two private instance attributes, `width` and `height`|
|2-rectangle.py			| a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with two public instance methods `def area(self):` and `def perimeter(self):`|
|3-rectangle.py			|a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle where by `print()` and `str()` should print the rectangle with the character `#`|
|4-rectangle.py			|a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with `repr()` returning a string representation of the rectangle to be able to recreate a new instance by using `eval()` |
|5-rectangle.py			|a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle and prints the message `Bye rectangle...` (`...` being 3 dots not ellipsis) when an instance of `Rectangle` is deleted |
|6-rectangle.py			|a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with public class attribute `number_of_instances`; Initialized to 0; Incremented during each new instance instantiation; Decremented during each instance deletion|
|7-rectangle.py			|a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with public class attribute `print_symbol`; Initialized to `#`; Used as symbol for string representation; Can be any type	|
|8-rectangle.py			|a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with a static  method `def bigger_or_equal(rect_1, rect_2):` that returns the biggest rectangle based on the area|
|9-rectangle.py			|a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with a class method `def square(cls, size=0):` that returns a new Rectangle instance with `width == height == size` |
